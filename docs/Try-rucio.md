Now that you've got a pretty good grasp of what Rucio is, why not try out your very own
local installation of Rucio? The setup guides that make up this section are prepared
for someone with beginner-level expertise. Make sure you read the pre-requisites guide
before starting off!

## Setting up a Rucio Demo environment

We've made the setup as quick as counting 1, 2, 3 by providing containerized versions of
our development environment. However, read through the [pre-requisites](setting-up-demo.md) quickly to ensure
you have everything you need to work in your demo.
