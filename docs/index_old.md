# Welcome to Rucioâ€™s documentation!

Rucio is a project that provides services and associated libraries for allowing scientific
collaborations to manage large volumes of data spread across facilities at
multiple institutions and organisations. Rucio has been developed by
[the ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/).

Rucio offers advanced features, is highly scalable, and modular. It is a data management
solution that could cover the needs of different communities in the scientific
domain (e.g., HEP, astronomy, biology).
